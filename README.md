## 🤔 What is the purpose of this application?

Singleton is a Creational Design Pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
<br/><br/>
There are several ways to implement a Singleton, whether it's eager or lazy... 
<br/><br/>
I thought it would be nice to create a project that unifies all these implementations.

This project contains a design mostly done by Bootstrap 5, does not contain server side but includes links to my github profile where there are 9 different implementations of Singleton Design Pattern written by Java language.

## 🤔 How it works?
I have created 9 implementations for Singleton Pattern.
<br/>
Each implementation has it’s own GitHub link.
